Detailed Description Original Articles

The repository includes several original research articles forming the study's foundation:

Original Article 1: Discusses advanced Real‑Time Power Quality Event Monitoring System Using Digital Signal

The Combined Article synthesizes the findings from the original articles, providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in radar signal processing and active cancellation systems. It integrates various methodologies, results, and discussions to present a holistic view of the research area. Presentation Files

The Presentation file is a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key points of the combined article. Additionally, the Presentation Video provides a recorded presentation for those who prefer a visual and auditory explanation of the research. Simulation Files

The simulations/ directory contains MATLAB codes used for the simulations presented in the articles. These files are essential for replicating the experiments and understanding the practical implications of the theoretical concepts discussed in the articles.

Simulation Code 1: MATLAB code for simulating radar signal processing techniques. Simulation Video: A recorded video demonstrating the simulations and their outcomes. Recorded Presentation Videos

In addition to the presentation slides, the repository includes recorded videos of the presentations:

Presentation Video: A comprehensive walkthrough of the PowerPoint presentation. Simulation Video: A detailed demonstration of the simulation files and their results. How to Use

Download the Repository: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.


Navigate through the folders to access the articles, presentations, and simulations. Installation

Ensure you have MATLAB installed to run the simulation codes. The presentation files can be opened with Microsoft PowerPoint or any compatible software. Running Simulations

Open MATLAB. Navigate to the simulations/ directory. Run the desired MATLAB script (e.g., simulation_code1.m) to execute the simulation.

sh

cd path-to-repository/simulations matlab -r simulation_code1

Watch the Simulation Video for a step-by-step guide on running the simulations. Contributing
